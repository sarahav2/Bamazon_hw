# Bamazon_hw
The goal was to create an Amazon-like store front using Node.js and MySQL.

#Getting Started
* Clone repo.
* Run command in Terminal or Gitbash 'npm install'
* Run command depending which mode you would like to be on:
   * Customer - 'npm run customer'
   * Manager - 'npm run manager'

Run 'ctrl + c' to exit each mode

##What Each JavaScript Does
BamazonCustomer.js

* Prints the products in the store.

* Prompts customer which product they would like to purchase by ID number.

* Asks for the quantity.

     * If there is a sufficient amount of the product in stock, it will return the total for that purchase.
     * However, if there is not enough of the product in stock, it will tell the user that there isn't enough of the product.
     * If the purchase goes through, it updates the stock quantity to reflect the purchase.
     * It will also update the product sales in the department table.
